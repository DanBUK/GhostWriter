This is the code for an Android based admin app for your [Ghost blog](http://ghost.org).

What does it bring to the table?
-------------
At the moment it's not more than just an interface to the admin-website but brings some nice features. The most prominent one is the no-clutter-interface as it does not show any web-browser related graphics. Also it's fast, really fast.

App(?) for what platform?
-------------
The app is written in Javascript with the [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) framework. This makes it portable in a write-once-deploy-to-all sort of manner. This app will in theory run equally great on android as on iOS and Wp8 and even on Blackberry but as I currently only own an Android device; that is what it's built for.

That sounds great, lets go! 
-------------
If you want to try it out for yourself you can find it on the google play store or build it as any other android project.

As for iOS and other platforms, sorry guys but no.

Great! Any bugs so far?
------------
Not that I know of. The editor-not-working bug was resolved as of Ghost v0.5.0.
